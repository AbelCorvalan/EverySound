# Noise

## Noise Spectral Density

Y Axis: (Noise Density in V/√Hz). Shows the noise spectral density. The scale is in nV/√Hz.

Why nV/√Hz? 

It's because that represents the amount of noise in a bandwidth of 1 Hz at any point in the frequency spectrum. It is defined as the square root of the power density per unit bandwidth.
