# PCB Design - MXR Distortion

In this document it'll describe design rules, constraints, criteria and features about `MXR Distortion PCB`.

## Constraints

In the follow image we can see the constraints implemented.

![Constraints](img/constraints.png)

These are test contratins example. That's must be changed due to routes width are low.

## Considerations

- Implement footswitch in the input circuit. One connection to the distortion circuit, other to clean signal.
